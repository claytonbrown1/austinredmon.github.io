  <p>One of the questions I get asked most often is what does the Circuit Court Clerk do? This office is one of the most misunderstood public offices in Kentucky and people often get it confused with the County Clerk’s office. Thankfully in Shelby County the County Clerk’s office and the Circuit Court Clerk’s office are in separate buildings to help alleviate some of the confusion.</p>
  <p>The Shelby County Circuit Court Clerk’s office is located at the Shelby County Judicial Center at 401 Main Street, Shelbyville, KY 40065. Formerly located at the old courthouse in Shelbyville, the Circuit Court Clerk’s office is now located on the first floor of the Judicial Center.</p>
  <p>The Shelby County Clerk’s office is located at 501 Washington Street, Shelbyville, KY 40065 in the Shelby County Courthouse Annex building. Though similar in name, the duties of each office are quite different. The Shelby County Clerk’s office is where you register and pay taxes on motor vehicles and boats, register to vote, and record legal land documents. This office is also responsible for conducting elections in Shelby County.</p>
  <p>Conversely, the Circuit Court Clerk’s office is charged with conducting the business of the courthouse (Judicial Center) in Shelby County. This elected office is entirely one of public service and, interestingly enough, it is one of only two elected offices in the Commonwealth of Kentucky where candidates must pass an exam in order to qualify to run. The exam consists of a general knowledge section similar to the SAT or ACT and a job-specific section. The latter part of the exam is composed of 3 parts including personnel, accounting, and policy.</p>
  <p>This office maintains all the court records of the Family, Circuit, and District divisions in our county. If any court-related document needs to be filed in Shelby County concerning a probate, divorce, adoption, custody, domestic violence, traffic, small claims, civil, or criminal case it would pass through this office. Along with filing these appropriate documents, this office is also where citizens would pay court-related fines. As such, there are important fiduciary responsibilities associated with this position that demand an elected Clerk with a strong financial-services background.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the most routine form of contact that the public has with this office is through the Driver’s License office. The Circuit Court Clerk’s office is responsible for issuing Kentucky driver’s licenses and identification cards to the public. Currently, this office only accepts cash and checks as payments whereas many other courthouses in Kentucky have added the option of paying by credit and debit cards.</p>
  <p>As with the Judicial Center as a whole, the hours for this office are limited to 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. during the weekdays. While the Shelby County Clerk’s office has extended evening hours on Thursdays, the Circuit Court Clerk’s does not offer this convenience. Courthouses throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky have extended the hours for the Driver’s License office at least one evening a week but Shelby County has not done so. This list includes courthouses in Henry, Oldham, Spencer, Anderson, Bullitt, and Jefferson County.</p>
  <p>The Administrative Office of the Courts serves as the central hub of information for all court systems in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Their website contains some valuable information pertinent to the Shelby County Circuit Court Clerk’s office <a href="https://courts.ky.gov/courts/clerks/Pages/default.aspx?county=Shelby">HERE</a>. However, Shelby County could very well benefit from having its own, autonomous Circuit Court Clerk’s website with more detailed and up to date information available to the public online.</p>
