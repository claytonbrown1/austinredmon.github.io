  <h2>Leadership By Example</h2>
  <h3><em>Public Service First begins with me.</em></h3>
  <p>The Circuit Court Clerk’s office cannot function effectively without leadership from the top and that means <strong>leading by example</strong>. I promise you <strong>I will learn how to perform every duty in the office</strong> so that I can step in and help whenever necessary. I would not presume to be able to lead a team without being able to execute the tasks that are expected of them. Whether someone is out sick, gone to lunch, or it simply gets busy, this office deserves an elected Clerk who knows how and is willing to step up and serve. That’s my first responsibility. If you come into the judicial center, you will not have to worry about where your elected Clerk is because <strong>I’ll be there on the front line, helping</strong>.</p>
  <h2>Respect to All</h2>
  <h3><em>Public Service First means taking care of everyone that works in the Circuit Court Clerk's office.</em></h3>
  <p>Shelby County deserves an elected Circuit Clerk who <strong>values the work that these deputy clerks perform every day</strong>. The men and women who work in the courthouse are public servants no less than any elected official. <strong>They deserve to be shown respect and to be treated with dignity</strong> and that’s exactly what they will get from me. No employee should ever be abused by any member of the public for doing their job and that will never happen on my watch. It is my duty to protect the public servants in that office and I intend to do so wholeheartedly.</p>
  <p>Shelby County deserves an elected Circuit Clerk who <strong>cares about improving the quality of service to the public</strong>. These public servants deserve every opportunity to serve our citizens well. This can be accomplished with <strong>proper training and cross-training</strong> of duties so as to ensure the office operates smoothly and service provided to the public is neither diminished nor delayed. I want to make sure every member of our team is able to provide quality service to each citizen regardless of that citizen’s need.</p>
  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
  <h3><em>Public Service First means building an office that is transparent and accessible for everyone.</em></h3>
  <p>In order to make it easier for people to access the Circuit Clerk’s office, we will <strong>extend the hours of the Driver’s License office</strong>. Currently the office is only open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday thru Friday. If you work during the day, especially if you work out of town, it’s next to impossible to get there without taking off work. That’s an unnecessary burden on taxpayers and we will remedy it.  Nearly every other courthouse in our region has at least one evening a week where the Driver’s License is open later including Henry, Oldham, Spencer, Anderson, Bullitt, and Jefferson County.  We can make this happen in Shelby County too <strong>without passing on any costs to taxpayers</strong>.</p>
  <p>Few people today carry cash and nearly all goods and services can be purchased with a card. So it should it be with the Circuit Clerk's office. We will <strong>expand payment options to include credit and debit cards</strong>. No longer should you have to worry about not having the right form of payment to pay a court fine or fee for renewing your license. By instituting this long-overdue service, people will not only be able to utilize this office with more convenience in person but card payments over the phone will finally be an option for those who can't physically make it into the office to pay their fines.  This is a common-sense solution that has been measured and tested well in numerous courthouses throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  We can do it here in Shelby County and <strong>remain budget neutral</strong>.</p>
