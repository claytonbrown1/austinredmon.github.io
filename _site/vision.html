  <h2>Leadership</h2>
  <h3><em>Public Service First begins with me.</em></h3>
  <p>The Circuit Court Clerk’s office cannot function effectively without leadership from the top and that means <strong>leading by example</strong>. I will learn how to perform every duty in the office so that I can step in and help whenever it is needed. I would not presume to be able to lead a team without being able to execute the tasks that are expected of them. Whether someone is out sick, gone to lunch, or it simply gets busy, this office deserves an elected Clerk who knows how and is willing to step up and serve. That’s my first responsibility.</p>
  <h2>Respect</h2>
  <h3><em>Public Service First means taking care of everyone that works in the Circuit Court Clerk's office.</em></h3>
  <p>The men and women who work in the courthouse are public servants no less than any elected official. They <strong>deserve respect and to be treated with dignity</strong> and that’s exactly what they will get from me. No employee should ever be abused by any member of the public for doing their job and that will never happen on my watch. It is my duty to protect the public servants in that office and I intend to do so wholeheartedly.</p>
  <p>These public servants deserve every opportunity to serve our citizens well. This can be accomplished with <strong>proper training and cross-training</strong> of duties so as to ensure the office operates smoothly and service provided to the public is neither diminished nor delayed. I want to make sure every member of our team is able to provide quality service to each citizen regardless of that citizen’s need.</p>
  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
  <h3><em>Public Service First means building an office that is transparent and accessible for everyone.</em></h3>
  <p>In order to make it easier for people to access the Circuit Clerk’s office, we are going to propose <strong>extending hours of operation</strong>. Currently the office is only open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday thru Friday. If you work during the day, especially if you work out of town, it’s next to impossible to get there without taking off work. That’s an unnecessary burden on taxpayers and we will remedy it. Opening earlier and closing later on particular days are common sense solutions that will be taken seriously if I am elected.</p>
  <p>Few people today carry cash and nearly all goods and services can be purchased with a card. So it should it be with the Circuit Clerk's office. We will <strong>expand payment options to include credit and debit cards</strong>. No longer should you have to worry about not having the right form of payment to pay a court fine or fee for renewing your license. By instituting this long-overdue service, people will not only be able to utilize this office with more convenience in person but card payments over the phone will finally be an option for those who can't physically make it into the office to pay their fines.</p>
  </p>For too long information concerning the Shelby County Judicial Center has been inaccessible to citizens unless they call or are physically at the office. We will <strong>create a Circuit Court Clerk website</strong> as a one-stop online resource for people wanting to know more about contact information, hours, court descriptions, and upcoming closings.  It’s time our courthouse moved into the 21st century with this valuable tool.</p>
