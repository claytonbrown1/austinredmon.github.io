<div id="bio-text">
  <p>Austin Redmon is running for Shelby County Circuit Court Clerk and is excited to bring his passion for public service to this office in 2018.</p>
  <img id="bio-img-1" src="/assets/img/redmonfamily2.jpg" alt="">
  <p>A lifelong citizen of Shelby County, Austin is proud to call Bagdad his home. He and his wife Emma are proud parents to their 2-year-old daughter Eleanor and a newborn son Henry. They also love being adoptive pet parents to two dogs, Moe and Buckshot and a cat, Ruthie.  Austin and his family are members of First Presbyterian Church in Shelbyville where his wife Emma is active in the choir.</p>
  <p>As the son of two public servants, he has always had a passion for helping others.  His dad, Stephen Brown, served three decades as a law enforcement officer in this community, first as a Kentucky Vehicle Enforcement Officer and later as a Shelby County Deputy Sheriff.  His mom, Veronica Brown, retired as a secretary with the Division of Water at the state.  It was by their example that Austin learned that public service is a noble calling.</p>
  <p>Austin studied Political Science and Economics at Cornell University and the University of Louisville and is a 2006 graduate of Shelby County High School. He is a proud alumnus of the Leadership Shelby Class of 2015.</p>
  <p>Austin has a long record of leadership in Shelby County, most notably with over 20 years in scouting.  He is a proud Eagle Scout and he volunteers as an Assistant Scoutmaster to Boy Scout Troop 270 where he mentors young scouts and teaches Citizenship merit badges.</p>
  <p>He serves his community as a member of the Bagdad Ruritan Club where he has previously served as President, Vice-President, and Zone Governor of all Ruritan Clubs in Shelby County. He is also a member of the Shelby County Farm Bureau, Shelby County Cattlemen’s Association, and the Delta Waterfowl Foundation.</p>
  <p>In the fall of 2017, Austin co-founded the Shelby County Young Professionals Association with Kendall Law. This group was formed as a bi-partisan organization designed to help get more young people elected locally. Today he serves as the Vice-President of this rapidly growing civic organization.</p>
  <img id="bio-img-2" src="/assets/img/austineleanor.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Since his first campaign for this office in 2010 at the age of 22 years old, he has spent his entire professional career working to prepare him to be an effective Circuit Court Clerk. Through working in multiple law firms and gaining experience in financial services and public relations, Austin has the necessary skills to lead this office well. Now, as a seasoned Paralegal with Brammell & Clubb, PSC, Austin has the right legal and leadership experience to take on the rigors of this position.</p>
  <p>He has worked with Circuit Court Clerk offices throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky and continues to do so today. Austin knows there are common-sense solutions to self-evident problems with this office. He has developed a comprehensive vision for the Circuit Court Clerk’s office centered around the simple idea of “Public Service First”. These are not radical ideas as they have been measured, tested, and proven well in numerous other courthouses. He is committed to implementing changes that will improve the quality of public service.</p>
  <p>With this unique combination of real-world experience and dedication to service, Austin Redmon has the right qualifications to serve as your next Circuit Court Clerk!</p>
